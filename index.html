      <p>
        Hi, I'm Nikki, a student in Info 474. This is my interactive portfolio
        where I'll share class projects and visualizations.

      <!-- CLOCK 1 -->
      <section>
        <h2>Clock 1 Prototype</h2>
        <div id="clock1-container"></div>
        <p class="clock-description">
          The runner goes around a circular track once every hour. The angle shows how far
          the runner is into the current hour (minute + seconds). The runner dot turns from
          cool to hot pink as they get tired throughout the hour. Background gets lighter
          in later hours of the day. This is meant to feel like a training loop.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- CLOCK 2 -->
      <section>
        <h2>Clock 2 Prototype</h2>
        <div id="clock2-container"></div>
        <p class="clock-notes">
          This clock treats each minute like a sprint rep. The teal bar fills left to right
          over the 60 seconds. Above it is digital time. This feels more
          like interval pacing. The runner can instantly see how deep they are into the
          current rep.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- CLOCK 3 -->
      <section>
        <h2>Clock 3 Prototype</h2>
        <div id="clock3-container"></div>
        <p class="clock-notes">
          A full loop route (like running around Yellow Lake in Issaquah). The marker moves around
          the loop as the minute and second pass. The checkpoints act like mile markers
          and light up when you pass them. The digital time sits at the bottom like a
          race clock.
