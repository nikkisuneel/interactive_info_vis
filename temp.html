      Hi, I'm Nikki, a student in Info 474. This is my interactive portfolio
      where I'll share class projects and visualizations.

        <h2>Clock 3 Prototype</h2>
        <div id="clock3-container"></div>
        <p class="clock-notes">
          A full loop route (like running around Yellow Lake in Issaquah). The marker moves around
          the loop as the minute and second pass. The checkpoints act like mile markers
          and light up when you pass them. The digital time sits at the bottom like a
          race clock.
